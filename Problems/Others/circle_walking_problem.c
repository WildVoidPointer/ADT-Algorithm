/* 
Description:
    Numbers from 1 to n are arranged in a circle, connected end-to-end. 
    Given a step size p, start from 1 and move forward p units at a time 
    until you land on a position that has already been visited. 
    Record all the positions visited and sort them in ascending order. 
    What is the k-th number in this sorted sequence? 
    (If there are fewer than k numbers, output -1).
